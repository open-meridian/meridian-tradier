"""The `dgm` suite, the SDK's own (meridian.suites, contract v18), run unchanged
against this plugin: every case mapped to the plugin's own conversion, from
Tradier's synthetic exchange, through the lake's half it runs in production
(lake.py), against the suite's `Recorder`.

Two cases describe what Tradier's US equity data never presents: a currency's
rate against another currency, and a crypto asset quoted in a stablecoin.
The suite has no way to say a source does not present a case unless it
asserts one value of a closed list, and these do not; so each is mapped to
the plugin's own recording path, with the row the plugin would send were its
source to state one. That proves the plugin names a cash instrument and a
token's own instrument as the contract has them, not that Tradier serves
either. The same holds for meridian-alpaca, and is raised with the lake's
plan.
