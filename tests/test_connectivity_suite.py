"""The connectivity suite (contract v22): every case Tradier presents, from the
plugin's own trading code and the simulated brokerage.

Each case is mapped to what Tradier's brokerage API answers for it, through the
simulated brokerage (synthetic_broker.py: a symbol for each answer, a
quantity that works or fills), and run through this plugin's own Trader
(trading.py) over its own adapter (venue.py) and client (broker.py),
against the runner's recorder; only the sidecar is stood in for. SIMULATED
ONLY: nothing reaches Tradier.

Seven cases are not presented, each with why (`NOT_PRESENTED`), as the
suite lets a case marked `about` or `about_field` be. And one required case
is not produced (`UNPRODUCED`): Tradier states no fee on a placement that
filled nothing, so the plugin has no charge to report; whether the suite
marks the case `about` is the product owner's to rule.
