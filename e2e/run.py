"""`make e2e`: the plugin on core's plugin harness, in synthetic mode, with no
key (the harness's README; plans/the-lake-prices-the-book, row 8). Its
recorded responses are the synthetic exchange shaped on Tradier's
documented and recorded responses (src/tradier/exchanges/exchange.json);
`make e2e-recorded RECORDED=<dir>` replays a developer's own recording, never
committed, through the same run.

Two plugins: `tradier`, this one, and `reader` (e2e/reader.py), a stand-in for
whatever reads prices, from the same image.

1. The catalogue: both datasets listed by `dashboard__list_datasets`, as the
   plugin declared them -- daily pulled and pushed, its day New York's to
   16:00; live pulled and streamed -- each with Tradier's terms, one
   person's, as its default licence.
2. Licensed and entitled: the deployment admin licenses both, and entitles
   the reader to both, the broker reloaded with each.
3. A close wanted: the reader reads SPY's close for 2026-10-08, which the lake
   has not got, so asks the plugin; the plugin records it against the want:
   573.86 in dollars, consolidated (no venue), its business date a plain
   date, published at the close, its raw record named.
4. A share class: BRK.B, asked of Tradier as BRK/B, its close and daily bar
   (no VWAP, as Tradier states none), its row keyed in the one spelling.
5. Not covered: TQQQ, known to the deployment only by another source's
   symbol, is declined: contract v18 grants a dgm no read of an instrument's
   record (W3.6), so the plugin serves the listings it resolved itself.
6. Live, on a venue the deployment does not hold: SPY's last price,
   consolidated, its trade's exchange by Tradier's code Q, recorded with no
   venue and the code as reported, and the miss counted (the harness has no
   platform to pull the venue from).
7. Parity: the plugin's pages, Connection and Datasets, read under Manage and
   through `/mcp` as `tradier__read_connection` and `tradier__read_datasets`,
   the same answers; neither shows a price.
8. Storage: the plugin's container made again keeps which listing each
   subject is, in the storage the deployment grants it.
9. `store lake`: each row as recorded, numbered with no holes, the wants
   answered and declined, the venue's miss.

Run by the Makefile from the repository's root, after it builds the image and
copies the harness out; standard library only.
