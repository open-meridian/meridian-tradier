"""`make e2e`: the plugin on core's plugin harness, on sample data, with no
key (the harness's README; plans/the-lake-prices-the-book, row 8). Its
recorded responses are the synthetic exchange shaped on Tradier's
documented and recorded responses (src/tradier/exchanges/exchange.json);
`make e2e-recorded RECORDED=<dir>` replays a developer's own recording, never
committed, through the same run.

Three plugins, from the same image: `desk` (e2e/desk.py), a stand-in that
places orders at Tradier's instance; `tradier`, this one; and `reader`
(e2e/reader.py), a stand-in for
whatever reads prices, from the same image.

1. The catalogue: the datasets listed by `dashboard__list_datasets`,
   as the plugin declared them -- daily pulled and pushed, its day New
   York's to 16:00; live pulled and streamed; trades streamed,
   kept two days; from 0.13.0 the chains' two, pulled and served, not
   kept -- each with Tradier's terms, one person's, as its default
   licence.
2. Licensed and entitled: the deployment admin licenses the three, and
   entitles the reader to them, the broker reloaded with each.
3. A close wanted: the reader reads SPY's close for 2026-10-08, which the lake
   has not got, so asks the plugin; the plugin records it against the want:
   573.86 in dollars, consolidated (no venue), its business date a plain
   date, published at the close, its raw record named.
4. A share class: BRK.B, asked of Tradier as BRK/B, its close and daily bar
   (no VWAP, as Tradier states none), its row keyed in the one spelling.
5. Another source's record: TQQQ, known to the deployment only as a
   custodian's book holds it (its CUSIP and the custodian's symbol), is
   wanted; the plugin reads the record (W3.6, a data plugin's from contract v18 as
   ruled 2026-10-10), finds its own symbol and records the close against
   the want: 82.45, keyed in the one spelling.
6. Live, on a venue the deployment does not hold: SPY's last price,
   consolidated, its trade's exchange by Tradier's code Q, recorded with no
   venue and the code as reported, and the miss counted (the harness has no
   platform to pull the venue from).
6b. Quotes (contract v19): the reader reads SPY's and BRK.B's latest quotes,
   which the lake has not got; live is streamed, so the read is a standing
   want, and the plugin records each listing's quote and streams them from
   then on: SPY's two-sided with its sizes in shares, BRK.B's with no offer.
6c. Trades: under those standing wants the synthetic stream's time and
   sales are recorded, kept two days: read over a range, a regular print
   eligible for every statistic with no aggressor and its sequence number,
   one withdrawn by its cancel as its next version, and one with a flag
   Tradier does not document, kept as reported, its eligibilities not
   known.
6d. Caught up from the lake: the trades recorded after the watermark the
   last read said, none read twice.
7. Parity: the plugin's pages, Connection and Datasets, the data role's
   (contract v20), read under Manage and through `/mcp` as
   `tradier__read_connection` and `tradier__read_datasets`, the same answers
   under the role's names, the stream's session among Tradier's own;
   neither shows a price.
8. Storage: the plugin's container made again keeps which listing each
   subject is, in the storage the deployment grants it; and (8b) it reads on
   start that each of its datasets is licensed, as Datasets then says.
9. `store lake`: each row as recorded, numbered with no holes, the wants
   answered and declined, the venue's miss.
10. From 0.6.0, the order path (e2e/orders.py): a third plugin, the desk
   (e2e/desk.py), places at Tradier's instance, holding `connectivity`
   beside `data`, and the plugin trades with its simulated brokerage; from
   0.7.0 Tradier holds `custody` too, its account linked, an order placed in
   Tradier's own app reported on no placement and accepted by the desk, and
   the desk, holding `operations`, reconciles the book against Tradier's
   statement with no break.

Run by the Makefile from the repository's root, after it builds the image and
copies the harness out; standard library only.
