"""`make e2e`'s order path (contract v22; from 0.6.0), after the data steps,
in the same harness (e2e/run.py calls it): Tradier holding `data` and
`connectivity` in sample data, and the desk (e2e/desk.py) holding
`portfolio`, `oms` and `ems`, as SnapTrade's e2e/orders.py. SIMULATED ONLY:
the plugin's simulated brokerage (src/tradier/synthetic_broker.py); no
Tradier, no sandbox and no brokerage API is reached.

1. Set up: an account for the orders, the desk's grants on it, Apple's
   record named by the desk and completed, the platform asked for its
   listing; Tradier made available and linked to the desk, the account mapped
   to the simulated account's code; trading enabled on it under the
   connectivity role's admin, on the plugin's Trading page; releases not
   waiting for compliance (no compliance plugin here).
2. A buy of 10, limit, day: released, claimed, placed at Tradier's instance,
   acknowledged with Tradier's order ID and filled 4 then 6; the order
   filled; the book's position up by 10 with its pending lines. The order
   the brokerage took outside the platform, on the mapped account, is left
   alone: no order recorded, no fill (venue-originated fills are v23's).
3. Good till date, which Tradier takes none of: rejected `unsupported`.
4. A replace and a cancel the desk asks for, each by its kind on the
   placement's change request: a working placement of 200 changed at Tradier
   to a limit of 229.50, the order keeping its ID, and the request applied; a
   replace to good till date, and one to a new quantity, which Tradier never
   changes, each refused `unsupported`, the placement working on; then
   cancelled at Tradier, then in the book.
5. A pause on Tradier: a placement held back, queued, nothing sent; lifted,
   it is sent and filled. A stop with a placement of 200 working: Tradier
   cancels it at once, reporting the cancel naming the stop; lifted again.
6. Tradier restarted with a placement working: it reads the book again,
   finds its order by the placement's venue order ID, sends no second order,
   and cancels it there when the desk asks.
7. `store book` prints the orders, placements and executions.

Standard library only.
