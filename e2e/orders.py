"""`make e2e`'s order path (contract v22; from 0.6.0) and, from 0.7.0, the
accounts' custody and reconciliation (contract v23), after the data steps,
in the same harness (e2e/run.py calls it): Tradier holding `data`, `custody`
and `connectivity` in sample data, and the desk (e2e/desk.py) holding
`portfolio`, `oms`, `ems` and `operations`, as SnapTrade's e2e/orders.py.
SIMULATED ONLY: the plugin's simulated brokerage
(src/tradier/synthetic_broker.py); no Tradier, no sandbox and no brokerage
API is reached.

1. Set up: an account for the orders, the desk's grants on it, Apple's
   record named by the desk and completed, the platform asked for its
   listing; Tradier made available and linked to the desk, the account mapped
   to the simulated account's code; trading enabled on it under the
   connectivity role's admin, on the plugin's Trading page; releases not
   waiting for compliance (no compliance plugin here). From 0.7.0, the
   plugin's Account currency set to USD for every linked account (Tradier
   states none), the account granted to Tradier and linked to its account on
   its Account links page; once its statement is in the street, the desk records the
   account's opening balance from it, as of the day before.
2. A buy of 10, limit, day: released, claimed, placed at Tradier's instance,
   acknowledged with Tradier's order ID and filled 4 then 6; the order
   filled; the book's position up by 10 with its pending lines. The order
   the brokerage took outside the platform before the account was watched
   is its history: no order recorded, no fill.
2b. Contract v23: an order of 5 placed in Tradier's own web app: its fills
   reported on no placement and held unmatched; the desk accepts
   them to a new order, which the book creates filled, the position up by
   5.
3. Good till date, which Tradier takes none of: rejected `unsupported`.
4. A replace and a cancel the desk asks for, each by its kind on the
   placement's change request: a working placement of 200 changed at Tradier
   to a limit of 229.50, the order keeping its ID, and the request applied; a
   replace to good till date, and one to a new quantity, which Tradier never
   changes, each refused `unsupported`, the placement working on; then
   cancelled at Tradier, then in the book.
5. A pause on Tradier: a placement held back, queued, nothing sent; lifted,
   it is sent and filled. A stop with a placement of 200 working: Tradier
   cancels it at once, reporting the cancel naming the stop; lifted again.
6. Tradier restarted with a placement working: it reads the book again,
   finds its order by the placement's venue order ID, sends no second order,
   and cancels it there when the desk asks.
7. `store book` prints the orders, placements and executions.
8. Reconciliation: once Tradier's statement shows every fill, the desk
   compares the book's positions with it, each security's and the cash's
   trade-date and settled quantities, and records a break for each
   difference: none, and `store book` holds no break.

Standard library only.
