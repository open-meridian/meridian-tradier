# The plugin's image. It runs beside a sidecar in the deployment's cluster, and
# reaches nothing but that sidecar and Tradier's market data API.
#
# Built on the base image for the SDK this plugin pins: Python and
# open-meridian, the same version as pyproject.toml's, already installed. So
# the image's own layer is this plugin alone (it has no other dependency), and
# an upload sends only that. Move the two together when moving to a new SDK.
#
# BASE is for building against a base made locally rather than a released one.
# The release by its tag and its digest, the image exactly; move both together.
