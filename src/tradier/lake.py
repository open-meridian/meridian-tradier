"""What the plugin records in the lake, and how it answers what the lake wants
(contract v18, W10; plans/the-lake-prices-the-book, the retail pair).

Two datasets, apart (the plan's Q21), each declared in the catalogue
(declaration.py):

- **daily**: each listing's close and daily bar for a business date, from
  the source's consolidated daily bars. Pulled: recorded when a reader's read
  is wanted (W10.7). Pushed: once a session's close is final, the day's
  closes of every listing it has served, unasked, so a book valued each
  evening finds them already kept. A day still forming is recorded and
  restated under the same row key as it fills, until final.
- **live**: the latest trade's price (`last`) and the best bid and ask. Pulled
  for a read, and kept current at the dataset's cadence while a standing want
  stands; nothing once it is withdrawn.

**Every subject is the deployment's own instrument.** The lake wants
instruments by the deployment's ID; the plugin asks the instrument store
what the record is (W3.6) and takes the listing's symbol from its
identifiers: the one this source reported (`symbol` at this source) where it
has one, else a `symbol` another source reported, in this source's one
spelling of a share class. Using another source's symbol, it reports its own
beside it (W3.1), so the record carries this source's code; where that
resolve is ambiguous it is reported as a miss (W3.2), and the want is still
answered for the subject the lake named. A subject whose record carries no
symbol is declined, not covered. Which symbol each subject is, is kept in
the plugin's storage, to rebuild from.

**Every venue is the venue master's.** A live price's exchange is resolved
by the code the source prints, as a `symbol` at this source (W3.14); a
venue the deployment does not hold is reported (W3.15), and the row is
recorded with no venue and the code as reported beside it, which no reader
takes for the consolidated view. A consolidated price names no venue.

What it recorded, declined and could not convert is counted here for the
Datasets page.
