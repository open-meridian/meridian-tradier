"""What the plugin records in the lake, and how it answers what the lake wants
(contracts v18 and v19, W10; plans/the-lake-prices-the-book, the retail
pair).

Three datasets, apart (the plan's Q21 and Q40), each declared in the
catalogue (declaration.py):

- **daily**: each listing's close and daily bar for a business date, from
  the source's consolidated daily bars. Pulled: recorded when a reader's read
  is wanted (W10.7). Pushed: once a session's close is final, the day's
  closes of every listing it has served, unasked, so a book valued each
  evening finds them already kept. A day still forming is recorded and
  restated under the same row key as it fills, until final.
- **live**: the latest trade's price (`last`) and the best bid and ask, as
  prices, and from contract v19 the best bid and offer as a quote, each side
  with its size. Pulled for a read; while a standing want stands, its prices
  kept current at the dataset's cadence and its quotes streamed, at most one
  a second per listing (the latest); nothing once it is withdrawn.
- **trades** (contract v19): each of Tradier's time and sales prints with
  the platform's trade attributes, converted at the edge (conditions.py),
  its sequence number kept, and no aggressor, which Tradier never states; a
  cancel the next version under the trade's row key, where it names a trade
  recorded here. Streamed for the listings under any standing want, and
  only those (the plan's Q40), in batches of up to 500. Streamed only:
  Tradier's time and sales history carries no sequence number to name a
  trade by, so neither a range nor the gap after a reconnect can be read
  without recording a trade twice; a reconnect is counted on the
  Connection page instead.

**Each row under its own record's key** (the carried fix): where the
deployment holds two records of one listing (one this source resolved, one
a custodian's, not yet merged), a close, a price, a trade or a quote is
recorded for each, and a row's key names the record it is about beside what
the source said (`SPY:1d:2026-10-08@LCL-...`), so the second is never
recorded under the first's key, which the lake took for a restatement; the
lake reads a row by its subject, so each record's reads find their own. An
identical repeat (a day still forming read again unchanged) carries the raw
record it was first recorded with, so the lake keeps it unchanged.

**Every subject is the deployment's own instrument.** The lake wants
instruments by the deployment's ID; the plugin asks the instrument store
what the record is (W3.6, a dgm's from contract v18 as ruled 2026-10-10)
-- the book's instruments came from a custodian, known by its identifiers
-- and takes the listing's symbol from its
identifiers: the one this source reported (`symbol` at this source) where it
has one, else a `symbol` another source reported, in this source's one
spelling of a share class. Using another source's symbol, it reports its own
beside it (W3.1), so the record carries this source's code; where that
resolve is ambiguous it is reported as a miss (W3.2), and the want is still
answered for the subject the lake named. A subject whose record carries no
symbol is declined, not covered. Which symbol each subject is, is kept in
the plugin's storage, to rebuild from.

**Every venue is the venue master's.** A live price's exchange is resolved
by the code the source prints, as a `symbol` at this source (W3.14); a
venue the deployment does not hold is reported (W3.15), and the row is
recorded with no venue and the code as reported beside it, which no reader
takes for the consolidated view. A consolidated price names no venue.

What it recorded, declined and could not convert is counted here for the
Datasets page.
