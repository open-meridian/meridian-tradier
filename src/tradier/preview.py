"""The pages as a deployment admin would see them, each printed as one HTML
file: for looking at the pages without a deployment.

    python -m tradier.preview datasets > preview/datasets.html

The page is `connection` (the default), `datasets` or `connection-no-key`.
Each is served by its own view, as the sidecar would ask it, over the
built-in synthetic exchange: a week of closes recorded for the exchange's
listings, two standing wants kept current, and a venue not held. It links
the kit where the dashboard serves it, /.meridian/ui/<version>/, so serve it
beside the kit to see it styled (meridian-ui's `make serve` serves the kit
under that path); opened on its own it is the page without the kit,
unstyled, which must work too. There is no sidecar here: what would be
recorded is recorded by the SDK's suite `Recorder`, and nothing leaves.
