"""The Tradier plugin: Tradier's US equity and ETF market data in an Open
Meridian deployment's lake, as a `dgm` (contract v18;
plans/the-lake-prices-the-book, the retail pair).

It connects to the sidecar it is launched beside, declaring its catalogue,
its settings and its storage (declaration.py) and its pages (page.py); on
each delivery of its settings it makes its Tradier client again with the
token (or, in synthetic mode, the built-in exchange) and asks whether Tradier
answers it; then it hears what the lake wants of it and records against
each want or declines it per subject (lake.py), and keeps its timetable:
standing wants kept current, days still forming read again, a final close
pushed.

It holds nothing it cannot lose: what each subject's symbol is, and every
raw response, are in the storage the deployment grants it (decisions/028);
a restart reads them back and hears the lake again. The token arrives as a
secret setting, never logged, shown or sent anywhere but Tradier.
