"""The kinds of raw record connectivity keeps, and their windows (contract
v16; meridian-design spec/an-edge-plugins-older-records-move-to-the-
archive), from 0.6.0.

Connectivity keeps what Tradier's brokerage API said, as its bytes arrived,
before anything is converted from it (decisions/028), in two kinds, each in
units the plugin can find again:

- `responses` ("Raw responses"): each read of the user's accounts and of an
  account's orders, in a unit per UTC day (`responses/2026-10-13/`); 30 days
  by default.
- `trading` ("Trading", contract v22): each exchange with the brokerage API
  that places, changes or cancels an order, every rejection this plugin made
  with nothing sent, and each account trading was enabled on, in a unit per
  month (`trading/2026-10/`); seven years by default (2555 days), as
  SnapTrade's.

A record's key is its path, `<kind>/<unit>/<name>`, which a row's
`RawRecordRef` names, then `#` and where in the record it points.

Past its kind's window a unit is archived, kept or deleted as the kind's
`<kind>_past_window` setting says, through the SDK (`tend`), which records
each move before anything is removed; a unit still being written (today's,
this month's) is never moved. What storage holds of each kind is said on
every heartbeat (`plugin.stored`). The data role's raw responses stay where
0.5.0 kept them (raw.py), apart from these.

Where the records live: `meridian.edge.storage_dir()` where the deployment
grants storage; a temporary directory otherwise, which a restart loses.
