"""The connectivity role (contract v22, and v23's venue-originated fills;
meridian-design plans/an-order-reaches-a-venue-through-the-book; W11.8 to
W11.12, W11.20), from 0.6.0, in
SnapTrade 0.16.0's shape (its trading.py), over Tradier's brokerage API
(venue.py, the adapter; broker.py, the client).

**What it does.** It hears each placement naming its own instance, and no
other's (the sidecar delivers a placement to the connectivity plugin it
names alone; one naming another is never acted on). For each queued one it
reads the placement's order from the book (ListOrders), the instrument's
record (ResolveInstrument) for the symbol Tradier names it by, and places it
at the venue in the account the placement's venue account code names -- the
code its `ems` mapped (`AccountScope.venue_account_map`), Tradier's account
number -- with the placement's ID as the order's tag, Tradier's client order
ID. It
reports what the venue did in the contract's meanings (ReportPlacement) and
every fill (ReportExecution), each with the raw record it was converted
from, kept in the plugin's storage with every request and answer (kinds.py,
the `trading` kind).

**Rejections, never refusals.** What the venue or this plugin does not
offer for the account -- an account on which trading was never enabled
(read-only until the connectivity role's admin enables it), an order type or
time in force its catalogue does not list, a strategy (Tradier works none
for the platform; the `ems` works strategies), a change of quantity (Tradier
changes an order's type, duration and prices, never its quantity), an
instrument with no symbol,
a code the key reaches no account under -- is the placement rejected
`unsupported`, nothing sent, its raw record what the decision was read from.
What the venue answered with a refusal is `venue rejected`, its code and
words as reported; a status the mapping does not know is outcome unknown,
`venue status not mapped`, the status as reported. A send never answered is
outcome unknown, `request unanswered`, and is resolved by reading the
account's orders for its tag, never by sending it again: before
every send the placement is noted in the plugin's storage (`Sent`,
`trading/sent.json`), so a placement the book still holds queued after a
restart is asked about, never sent twice.

**Fills.** Tradier offers no stream of an account's orders on its sandbox,
so its orders are read on a poll (every `POLL_SECONDS`), the filled quantity
growing between two reads. Where the growth is the last fill Tradier states
on the order (`last_fill_quantity` at `last_fill_price`), the fill is
reported as stated (kind `venue reported`); otherwise, with only the average
price, it is inferred (kind `inferred`), its price worked out from the two
averages (exact where it divides; otherwise rounded half-even to
`PRICE_PLACES` places, which the log says). Either way its ID is derived
from the venue's order ID and the filled quantity it brought the order to,
so a fill read again on a poll, or after a restart, is the same fill
(requirement 33). Its trade date is the date its time falls on in New York,
the listing market's. Tradier states no fill's settlement date, so every
fill carries the date read's (ComputeDate, `computed_settlement_date` with
its basis); where it answers none, the fill waits for the next read, never
sent with a guessed date.

**Busts.** Tradier states no bust or correction: its order statuses have
none, and nothing it serves names one (so the suite's `reports-a-bust` is
not presented). A filled quantity that fell between two reads would still be
the venue taking fills back: each fill reported beyond what
the venue now states is busted, a ReportExecution of quantity 0 superseding
the book's execution, its ID derived as the fill's was.

**The firm's controls.** It reads the trading instructions in force on
start and hears each change. Under a pause or a stop on All accounts, on
this instance, or on a placement's account, it sends nothing new: a queued
placement is held, and sent once the instruction is lifted if the book still
holds it queued. A stop cancels at the venue at once every placement it is
working that the stop covers, and reports each cancel as a fact naming the
stop's entry (RequestPlacementChange with `cause.entry_id`).

**A change the `ems` asks for** is read from the placement's change requests
(`Placement.change_requests`), each by its kind. A cancel is sent at the
venue. A replace is sent where the venue changes the order (Tradier's `PUT
/accounts/{id}/orders/{order_id}`: its type, duration and prices, the order
keeping its ID), and reported replaced with the quantity and limit now; one
asking a new quantity is refused `unsupported`, nothing sent. A change the
venue refused, or a replace this plugin or the account's catalogue does not
offer, is the placement rejected while it works, which the book reads as the
venue refusing the change: the request ends refused and the placement works
on. A replace never answered is not sent again: the read showing the order
replaced reports it.

**Its catalogue.** On start, and when trading is enabled on an account, it
publishes per venue account code the order types and times in force the
venue takes for it (ReportVenueCatalogue), and none for a read-only one;
`execution_acknowledgement` none, the venue taking no execution
acknowledgement (contract v23); never a strategy.

**Venue-originated fills** (contract v23; the order-path plan's rulings 1
and 8 to 19). An order the venue lists on a mapped account that no
placement names -- one placed in the broker's own app -- is never recorded
as an order: only its fills are reported, on no placement
(ReportExecution naming the venue account code, the instrument its symbol
resolves to, the side, the venue order ID and the client order ID it
carries), each derived to its ID as any fill is, so the book holds it
unmatched until its `ems` accepts it or answers it DK. Only fills after the
plugin first watched the account are reported (`trading/originated.json`
keeps when, and each such order's fills): an order filled before then is
the account's history, which its opening balance holds. Once accepted, the
book creates a placement at filled naming the venue order; the plugin hears
it (PlacementUpdated) and reports the order's later fills on it. After a
DK, a later fill is reported on no placement again. The venue is told
nothing either way: it takes no execution acknowledgement. A fill whose
symbol names none of the deployment's records is reported missing
(ReportMissingInstrument) and waits, since a fill on no placement names its
instrument. A venue order with no fill is never reported.

**A venue's symbol on a fill** that is not the symbol placed is resolved by
the fill's time (ResolveIdentifier) and, where it names none of the
deployment's records, reported missing (ReportMissingInstrument); the fill
is reported on the placement either way.

What it does not do: a locate (no locate API), a place of execution (the
venue states none on a fill), a charge on a placement (the venue states no
fee naming an order), an execution acknowledgement (the venue takes none).
