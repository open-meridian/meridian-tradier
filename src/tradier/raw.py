"""Tradier's raw responses, kept as the plugin's raw records (decisions/028).

Every response Tradier sends -- a refusal and a rate limit as much as a bar
-- is kept before anything is converted from it, exactly as
its bytes arrived, with the request that asked for it (its URL, and its
headers less Tradier's authentication header, which is never kept) and
the moment it was received. A row converted from it carries a
`RawRecordRef` whose key is the record's key, then `#` and where in the
record the row came from (`#0`, a history's first day; `#SPY/bid`, a
quote's side), so a person auditing a row follows it here and finds exactly
what Tradier said.

Where the records live: `meridian.edge.storage_dir()` when the deployment
grants the instance storage (a `dgm` is an edge role); a temporary directory
in the tests; `recordings/`, git-ignored, for `make live`, the account
holder's live check (real recordings stay theirs: the lake plan's Q11). No
other plugin reads them.
